This web application leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and process text data. 
Built using a Flask backend and integrated with NLP , it provides features such as:

Sentiment Analysis: Evaluate the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of input text.
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identify entities such as names, organizations, dates, and locations within the text.
Language Analysis : Language detection is the process of automatically identifying the language of a given text.
